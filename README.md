1. Training Task: Single-Qubit Rabi Calibration using QUA/Controller

Procedure to calibrate the amplitude of a single-qubit X-gate using Rabi oscillations.

Task:
Generate a series of pulses with varying amplitudes.

- Apply them to the qubit.

- Measure the qubit's response.

- Plot the measurement result as a function of pulse amplitude.

- Choose the optimal amplitude for a π-pulse (X-gate).

2. Training Task: Ramsey Interferometry

Implement a Ramsey interferometry procedure for a single qubit in order to:

- Precisely determine the qubit's frequency.

- Estimate the phase decoherence time — T₂*.

- Plot the resulting data and extract the relevant parameters.
